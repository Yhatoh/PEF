# Requirement

To use this version of PEF, you have to use this versions of sdsl-lite, that has a little difference.

### rank operation

#### Description

Given an position `i`, do `rank(i)`

#### Algorithm

The rank operation first of all has to do a rank in the vector `L` to know in which block the bit i is.

Then, if the block is not the first block, it has to sum `b` ones times the number of blocks before the actual block, this is because before this block there is `b` ones for each block.

Then, depending of the value of `B[blk]` and `P[blk]` it will use different rank operations:
* if `B[blk] = 1` the block uses Elias-Fano Encoding, so we will use rank operation of that encoding, then:
  * if the block is the first block it can do the operation rank with the value of `i`
  * if the block is not the first block, then it has to know the position of the `i` bit in that block, to do that is has to do the difference between `i - 1`and the result of a select in `L` with the value of the block, to know what was the position of the last `1` from the previous block, and finally we can do rank with that value
* if `B[blk] = 0 && P[blk] != NULL` the block uses a plan bit vector encoding, so we will use rank operation of that encoding, then:
  * if the block is the first block it can do the operation rank with the value of `i`
  * if the block is not the first block, then is has to know the position of the `i` bit in that block, to do that it has to do the difference between `i - 1` and the result of a select in `L` with the value of the block, to know what was the position of the last `1` from the previous block, and finally we can do rank with that value
* if `B[blk] = 0 && P[blk] == NULL` the block is full of ones, then:
  * if the block is the first block the result of the rank is just `i`
  * if the block is not the first block, it has to know the position of the `i` bit in that block, to do that have to do the difference between `i - 1` and the result of a select in `L` with the value of the block, to know what was the position of the last `1` from the previous block, and the rank of in that block will be that value
